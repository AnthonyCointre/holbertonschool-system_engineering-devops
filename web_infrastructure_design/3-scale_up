Scale up

- Components of the infrastructure:

    - Load Balancers (HAProxy):
        - A second load balancer is added and configured as a cluster with the existing one. This cluster setup ensures high availability. If one load balancer fails, the other can take over, preventing downtime.

    - Web Server (Nginx):
        - The web server is moved to its own dedicated server to reduce resource contention and to ensure that web traffic processing does not interfere with other services.

    - Application Server:
        - The application server is hosted on its own dedicated server, allowing it to handle dynamic requests more efficiently without competing for resources with the web server or database.

    - Database Server (MySQL):
        - The database server is isolated on its own server to ensure that database operations are not hindered by other processes and to improve the performance and security of the data.
